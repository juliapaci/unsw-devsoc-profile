# wait a sec, this isnt a regular website?

yes you are correct, what a keen eye you have! not only does this website not adhere to web standards but it also ignores the "Around The World" theme.

I was planning on porting my graphics abstraction library ["Familiar"](https://github.com/juliapaci/familiar) to the web via webgpu or webgl which wouldve been fun however i probably wouldve ran out of time so i wouldnt be able to submit by the 19th feb deadline (because i also need to implement truetype vector font parsing and rendering which wouldve been a whole nother thing but anyways)

So now im stuck having to do a normal webpage but i dont want to because:
    1. i dont like the current web standards
        - HTTP is a bloated and obnoxious protocol
        - HTML and CSS are trash
        - and JS is a scripting language that was somehow made to be the standard even though its a dynamically and weakly typed mess that is now implemented in many different ways across engines which follow unique specs. what an ugly mess)
    2. i dont like using the current web because its full of seo optimized corporate nonsense. the indie web is good but the main thing that makes it interesting and enjoyable is the very thing that also makes it annoying which is that it is niche and hard to access.
    3. me committing to this even for something as trivial as an application is me accepting this fact (which i will never ever ever ever do)

and also, we cant fix it. like at all :( -- https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png

also i dont appreciate or care for (at all) web design. maybe some really unique stuff would be cool but maybe im just not that creative or maybe i cant see things how the designer intended it to be seen yk?

markup languages are fine for this (although your browser probably isnt rendering it as such because they are stupid or ignorant) but im assuming im gonna be automatically ignored by whoever is reading this which is kinda sad
